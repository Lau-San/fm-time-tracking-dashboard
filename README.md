## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

This is my first React project so I gained some valuable experience on that.

I also learned how to use Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

This time I used `create-react-app` but I've heard that it's not the best way to do things, so in the future I'll look into other alternatives like Vite.

### Useful resources

-   [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - I learned all I needed from the official Tailwind CSS Documentation
